### Qualitative Comparison with Standin

For this comparison, Target Video 6 and Target Video 7 are taken directly from the official project homepage of Stand-in. We test these videos using different source identity images. As can be seen, Stand-in's performance is highly unstable across different source images, demonstrating poor preservation of attributes such as hairstyle, background, and pose. **It is worth noting that these two target videos contain no complex motions**. When we test with target videos that include more dynamic actions (e.g., Target Video 1 to 5), the degradation in quality becomes even more pronounced.
